# Nbb

Not [babashka](https://babashka.org/). Node.js babashka!?

CLJS scripting on Node.js.

## Status

Experimental.

## Goals

Nbb's main goal is to make it _easy_ to get started with ad hoc CLJS scripting
on Node.js.

Additional goals are:

- Fast startup without relying a custom version of Node.js.
- Support building small TUI apps using [Reagent](#reagent).
- Complement [babashka](https://babashka.org/) with libraries from the Node.js ecosystem.

What's next? Leave some feedback on the [Github Discussions](https://github.com/borkdude/nbb/discussions) forum or join the
  `#nbb` channel on Clojurians Slack.

## Usage

Install `nbb` from NPM:

```
$ npm install nbb -g
```

Omit `-g` for a local install.

Try out an expression:

``` clojure
$ nbb -e '(+ 1 2 3)'
6
```

And then install some other NPM libraries to use in the script. E.g.:

```
$ npm install csv-parse
$ npm install shelljs
```

Create a script which uses the NPM libraries:

``` clojure
(ns script
  (:require ["csv-parse/lib/sync" :as csv-parse]
            ["fs" :as fs]
            ["shelljs" :as sh]))

(println (count (str (fs/readFileSync "script.cljs"))))

(prn (sh/ls "."))

(prn (csv-parse "foo,bar"))
```

Call the script:

```
$ nbb script.cljs
264
#js ["CHANGELOG.md" "README.md" "bb.edn" "deps.edn" "main.js" "node_modules" "out" "package-lock.json" "package.json" "shadow-cljs.edn" "src" "test.cljs"]
#js [#js ["foo" "bar"]]
```

## Reagent

Nbb includes `reagent.core` which will be lazily loaded when required. You
can use this together with [ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) to create
a TUI application:

```
$ npm install ink
```

`ink-demo.cljs`:
``` clojure
(ns ink-demo
  (:require ["ink" :refer [render Text]]
            [reagent.core :as r]))

(defonce state (r/atom 0))

(doseq [n (range 1 11)]
  (js/setTimeout #(swap! state inc) (* n 500)))

(defn hello []
  [:> Text {:color "green"} "Hello, world! " @state])

(render (r/as-element [hello]))
```

<img src="img/ink.gif"/>

## Startup time

``` clojure
$ time nbb -e '(+ 1 2 3)'
6
nbb -e '(+ 1 2 3)'   0.17s  user 0.02s system 109% cpu 0.168 total
```

The baseline startup time for a script is about 170ms seconds on my laptop. When
invoked via `npx` this adds another 300ms or so, so for faster startup, either
use a globally installed `nbb` or use `$(npm bin)/nbb script.cljs` to bypass
`npx`.

## How does this tool work?

CLJS code is evaluated through [SCI](https://github.com/borkdude/sci), the same
interpreter that powers [babashka](https://babashka.org/). Because SCI works
with advanced compilation, the bundle size, especially when combined with other
dependencies, is smaller than what you get with self-hosted CLJS. That makes
startup faster. The trade-off is that execution is less performant and that only
a subset of CLJS is available (e.g. no deftype, yet).

## Optional dependencies

Nbb depends on React to load the optional [Reagent](#reagent) module. To not
download react when installing nbb, use `npm install nbb --no-optional`.

## Build

Prequisites:

- [babashka](https://babashka.org/) >= 0.4.0
- [Clojure CLI](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started#_clojure_installer_and_cli_tools) >= 1.10.3.933
- Node.js 16.5.0 (lower version may work, but this is the one I used to build)

To build:

- Clone and cd into this repo
- `bb release`
