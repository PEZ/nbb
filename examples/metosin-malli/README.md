# Malli

This example shows how you can use [malli](https://github.com/metosin/malli)
with nbb. Since malli is compiled into its own module which is published in a
separate npm library, you have to add it explicitly to the `package.json` using
the same version as nbb.

To run this example, run `npm install` and then `npx nbb
example.cljs` (so Node will use the nbb version of this project).
