# Sitefox

[Sitefox](https://github.com/chr15m/sitefox) is a Node.js + CLJS web framework.

To start the web server, first run `npm install` and then `npm run fox` (or `bb
fox` if you have [babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka) installed).

This example requires `nbb` v0.0.97 or higher.

See it in action [here](https://twitter.com/borkdude/status/1446789040188051463).

To develop with nREPL, run `bb dev`.
